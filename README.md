# BasicMicroGradEngine
fun intro to backpropagation and neural networks (following some Andrej Karpathy stuffs). Implements a micrograd engine for mathemaatical expressions (nice applications of topological sort here for algo nerds). We use this to implement a nn library so we can build basic MLP and run fancy things like SGD on it to minimise some loss functions!
